## Designing and Simulating 4-bit USR in HDL

One of the most important elements of computing systems is the **Universal Shift Register**(USR) which is capable of both unidirectional and bidirectional shifting along with parallel loading. Designing, implementing, and simulating this component from scratch is quite challenging as it requires a good grasp of the logical working of registers in addition to the programming requirements to do so. 

The logical components are configured as shown in the following image,

Simulating a small-scale 4-bit version provides enough sophistication to ensure conceptual integrity as well as practicality. The construction and operation of digital logic circuits are described using the specialized computer language known as **hardware description language**(HDL). HDL offers little to no abstraction enabling us to directly achieve the desired task.

The following HDL instance corresponds to the **PIPO**(**P**arallel **I**n **P**arallel **O**ut) illustration,

This project allowed me to realize the complexities of even the most simple components used in pretty much every modern Computing devices.
