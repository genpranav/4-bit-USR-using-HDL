One of the most important elements of computing systems is the Universal Shift Register(USR) which is capable of both unidirectional and bidirectional shifting along with parallel loading. Designing, implementing, and simulating this component from scratch is quite challenging as it requires a good grasp of the logical working of registers in addition to the programming requirements to do so. 

Simulating a small-scale 4-bit version provides enough sophistication to ensure conceptual integrity as well as practicality. The construction and operation of digital logic circuits are described using the specialized computer language known as hardware description language (HDL). HDL offers little to no abstraction enabling us to directly achieve the desired task.
